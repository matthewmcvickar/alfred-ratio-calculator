# Alfred Ratio Calculator

Easily calculate the missing number in a ratio.

Given `2/4 = ?/10`, type **`rr 2 4 x 10`** and get **5**!

## Installation

1. **[Download the workflow.](https://github.com/matthewmcvickar/alfred-ratio-calculator/raw/master/Ratio%20Calculator.alfredworkflow)**

2. Double-click on the **Ratio Calculator.alfredworkflow** file you just downloaded to add it to Alfred. (Optionally, categorize the workflow under 'Tools' in the the 'Category' dropdown.)

3. Click the **Import** button.

4. The default trigger keyword is `rr`. Change this as you see fit. To do so, double-click the leftmost of the two blocks that represent the workflow--that is, the one that says 'Script Filter'--and change the 'Keyword' field to your preferred trigger.

## Usage

1. Launch Alfred.

2. Start the ratio calculator by typing `rr` and a space.

3. Type a ratio equation as a series of three numbers and one non-number to indicate the missing value.

  For example, to find the missing number in the equation 2/4=x/10, type:

  ```
  2 4 x 10
  ```

  You can use `x`, `?`, or any non-number character to indicate the number you want to find.

4. The result will show up in the feedback list below as you finish your equation. Hit <kbd>Return</kbd> to copy the result to your clipboard.
